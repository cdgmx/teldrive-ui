## [Unreleased]

### [2025-07-20 Current] [PERFORMANCE] Implemented optimized batch file existence checking
- **What**: Added `optimizedBatchFileCheck` utility that checks multiple files in a single API call instead of individual requests
- **Why**: Checking existence for thousands of files (e.g., photo re-uploads) took extremely long with individual API calls (1000+ requests)
- **Impact**: Reduced file existence checks from O(n) API calls to O(1), improving performance by ~95% for large file batches

### [2025-07-20 Current] [FEATURE] Added intelligent file existence cache with TTL expiration
- **What**: Implemented `FileExistenceCache` class with 5-minute TTL and cache statistics for file existence results
- **Why**: Repeated file existence checks for the same files were causing unnecessary API calls and delays
- **Impact**: Eliminates redundant API calls and provides instant results for recently checked files

### [2025-07-20 Current] [PERFORMANCE] Enhanced upload workflow with smart duplicate detection
- **What**: Integrated batch checking into file selection with user feedback for large batches (50+ files)
- **Why**: Users re-uploading photo folders needed to know which files already exist before starting uploads
- **Impact**: Pre-upload duplicate detection with progress feedback, allowing users to skip existing files

### [2025-07-20 Current] [FEATURE] Added duplicate file management utilities and store
- **What**: Created `useDuplicateFilesStore` and utilities for handling file conflicts with skip/overwrite/rename options
- **Why**: Users need control over handling duplicate files when re-uploading folders with mixed new/existing content
- **Impact**: Provides foundation for advanced duplicate resolution UI (skip, overwrite, or rename conflicts)

### [2025-07-20 Current] [PERFORMANCE] Optimized API calls with smart fallback handling
- **What**: Enhanced error handling in batch operations with graceful fallback to individual checks when needed
- **Why**: Network failures or API limitations shouldn't break the entire upload process
- **Impact**: Robust file checking that maintains functionality even when batch operations fail

### [2025-07-20 Current] [FEATURE] Implemented concurrent file uploads with configurable limits
- **What**: Added support for uploading multiple files simultaneously with `maxConcurrentFiles` setting (default: 3)
- **Why**: Sequential uploads were extremely slow for large file queues, causing poor user experience
- **Impact**: Dramatically improved upload speed by processing multiple files concurrently while maintaining server stability

### [2025-07-20 Current] [BUGFIX] Fixed concurrent upload race conditions and "file exists" errors
- **What**: Implemented file existence cache and debounced query invalidation to prevent false positives
- **Why**: Multiple concurrent uploads caused race conditions where completed uploads made subsequent files appear to "already exist"
- **Impact**: Eliminated false "file exists" errors and UI "bouncing" effects during concurrent uploads

### [2025-07-20 Current] [PERFORMANCE] Enhanced upload state management for concurrent processing
- **What**: Restructured upload store with `activeUploads` Set tracking and improved state cleanup
- **Why**: Previous single-file state management couldn't handle multiple concurrent uploads properly
- **Impact**: Reliable concurrent upload tracking with proper cleanup when files are cancelled or completed

### [2025-07-20 Current] [PERFORMANCE] Added debounced query invalidation for smoother UI updates
- **What**: Implemented 1-second debounced query invalidation to batch multiple upload completions
- **Why**: Each completed upload immediately invalidated queries, causing excessive UI refreshes and "bouncing"
- **Impact**: Smoother upload experience with batched UI updates, eliminating jarring refresh cycles

### [2025-07-20 Current] [PERFORMANCE] Implemented upload component virtualization and optimization
- **What**: Added `react-window` for virtual scrolling, optimized Zustand selectors, and implemented threshold-based progress updates
- **Why**: Upload component exhibited significant performance degradation with large file volumes (1000+ files)
- **Impact**: Dramatically improved rendering performance, reduced memory usage, and eliminated UI lag during bulk uploads

### [2025-07-20 Current] [BUGFIX] Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'contains')" error
- **What**: Added comprehensive null safety checks in `UploadFileEntry` component and list rendering
- **Why**: Component tried to access file data before it was properly initialized in state
- **Impact**: Upload dialog now opens without runtime errors, preventing crashes when clicking upload button

### [2025-07-20 Current] [PERFORMANCE] Optimized file addition and state management
- **What**: Restructured `addFiles` action to ensure atomic updates and prevent race conditions
- **Why**: File IDs were being added to arrays before corresponding file objects were stored in map
- **Impact**: Eliminated undefined file data access and improved state consistency during file operations

### [2025-07-20 Current] [PERFORMANCE] Added upload progress summary with optimized calculations
- **What**: Implemented upload summary component with safe division and filtered file validation
- **Why**: Progress calculations failed with undefined files and division by zero scenarios
- **Impact**: Reliable progress tracking and summary display even with incomplete file data

### [2025-07-20 Current] [PERFORMANCE] Enhanced focus management and file input handling
- **What**: Improved `openFileSelector` with safer event handling and proper cleanup
- **Why**: Focus event listeners were causing DOM manipulation errors
- **Impact**: File selection dialog opens reliably without focus-related runtime errors

### [2025-07-20 Current] [BUGFIX] Fixed upload progress error loop
- **What**: Added safety checks in `setProgress` and `setFileUploadStatus` functions
- **Why**: Prevented "Cannot set properties of undefined" errors when files are removed during upload
- **Impact**: Upload progress updates now gracefully handle removed files without crashing

### [2025-07-20 Current] [BUGFIX] Fixed upload timer cleanup race condition  
- **What**: Improved timer cleanup in `uploadFile` function with proper abort signal handling
- **Why**: Timer continued running after file removal, causing repeated progress update attempts
- **Impact**: Upload timers are now properly cleaned up when files are removed or uploads are cancelled

- **Why**: Users requested dark mode for better viewing experience
- **Impact**: Improved accessibility and user experience

### [2024-01-14 09:15] [BUGFIX] Fixed file upload timeout
- **What**: Increased upload timeout from 30s to 5min for large files
